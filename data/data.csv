100,Frank Sinatra,"A 64-year-old Caucasian male patient with a history of hypertension and 10 years paroxysmal AF was referred to our Blue Note Hospital Medical Center in Barcelona. Treatment with class IC and III antiarrhythmic drugs had failed, and the patient experienced progressive frequency and severity of palpitations and fatigue. The CHA2DS2-VASc score was 1 (hypertension). The patient’s body mass index was 28.3 kg/m2 (97 kg, 185 cm) at time of referral. In the workup for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), transthoracic echocardiography results showed normal cardiac function, and a left atrial volume indexed of 29.1 mL/m2. The transcatheter PVI using radiofrequency energy was performed. After the PVI, the patient lost 10 kg with the help of our institutional patient-tailored 3-month cardiac rehabilitation program, which constituted low-intensity exercise guided by a physiotherapist, a balanced diet supported by our institutional nutritionist, and nutritional psychoeducation provided by a psychologist. Thereafter, the patient was free of atrial arrhythmias during the first 6 months. In the next 6 months, the patient lost another 4 kg, arriving at 83 kg. Two years after the first PVI, the patient regained weight up to 98 kg and experienced a symptomatic recurrence of paroxysmal AF, which was confirmed by 24-hour Holter monitoring. A second electrophysiological examination and PVI were scheduled, but with physical exercise the patient managed to lose weight to 89 kg. From that point, he was asymptomatic and in sinus rhythm. The re-PVI was therefore not performed. The patient was in sinus rhythm for over 1 year, until he regained weight up to a total of 100 kg. This time, the recurrent AF episode was classified as persistent, which was confirmed by 24-hour Holter monitoring. The patient underwent elective electrocardioversion, and flecainide was restarted. Another year later, weighing 103 kg, the patient continued to have severely symptomatic AF, with an AF burden on 24-hour Holter monitoring of 39%. The patient was again referred to our cardiac rehabilitation facility; the patient lost 20 kg again, and symptomatic AF disappeared. Since then, neither AF nor other atrial arrhythmias have been seen on 24-hour Holter monitoring."
101,Ella Fitzgerald ,"A 35-year-old female patient from Harlem was admitted with a chief complaint of worsening dyspnea for the last 3 months (New York Heart Association class III). She had an episode of syncope with bilateral upper limb numbness a month ago. History was significant for surgical removal of left atrial myxoma in 2015. Medical records of the previous cardiac surgery were not available. Family history was negative for such illness in the siblings or parents. Her physical examination was unremarkable except for the presence of a previous sternotomy scar. Patient had BMI 35.2 and routine laboratory parameters and endocrine hormone levels such as thyroid hormones, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and growth hormone were within normal limits. Whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan was performed to exclude any other primary tumor. Non-contrast CT scan of the brain showed an old wedge-shaped infarct in the right temporoparietal region with gliotic changes. 2-D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a 20 × 19 mm hyperechoic mass in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) adherent to a ventricular aspect of the anterior mitral leaflet (AML). The mass swung back and forth with each beat into the LVOT cavity. There was no LVOT obstruction, no aortic regurgitation, trace mitral regurgitation with normal ventricular function."
102,John Coltrane,"A 27-year-old male with T1DM and paroxysmal AF since the age of 10 years was referred to an NYC endocrinology clinic for specialized diabetes care owing to increasing insulin requirements and resistance. At baseline, the patient weighed 205 pounds, which had increased significantly by approximately 40 pounds in the last year, and had a body mass index of 38 kg/m2 and hemoglobin A1c level of 7.4%. He used hybrid closed loop insulin pump technology with continuous glucose monitoring in 100% automation mode. The patient used on average 55.4 units of basal insulin and 26.5 units of bolus per day (total daily dose, 81.9 units) with a time in range (TIR) of 31%. The patient was started on tirzepatide 2.5 mg weekly and titrated to 7.5 mg weekly with 4-week dose titrations. After 12 weeks, the patient's TIR had doubled to 61% with improvements in glucose variability, insulin requirements had decreased to 57.6 units per day, HbA1c had decreased to 6.9%, daily carbohydrates had decreased by approximately 24%, and weight had decreased to 188 pounds."
